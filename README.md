Macro-nutrient calculator that provides meal ideas based on the calculator results.

  The macro calculator is an innovative tool that uses a combination of technologies such as Postgres, Google Cloud, WordPress, HTML, CSS, Python, and JSON to suggest meal plans to users based on their daily nutrient requirements. The tool aims to simplify the process of tracking macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and offers personalized meal plans to users based on their individual dietary needs.
    The first step in creating this tool was to set up a database using Postgres and JSON. This allowed us to store user data such as their height, weight, age, and activity level, which was used to calculate their daily nutrient requirements. We also used a separate database to store information about various foods and their nutritional content.
    Next, we utilized Google Cloud to host our application and ensure scalability and reliability. We used WordPress to create the frontend of the application and make it user-friendly. HTML and CSS were used to design the interface, while Python was used to handle the backend functionalities such as calculating nutrient requirements and suggesting meal plans.
    To provide personalized meal plans, the application uses JSON to communicate with the database and retrieve information about the user's nutrient requirements. Based on this information, the tool suggests meal plans that meet the user's daily nutrient requirements and include foods that they like to eat.
    Overall, the macro calculator is a powerful tool that combines the use of multiple technologies to simplify the process of tracking macronutrients and provide personalized meal plans to users based on their individual dietary needs.
